 * Assignment: 
 * 1. Install the FlexCAN2 library by selecting Sketch -> Include Library -> Add Zip Library
 *    Select the FlexCAN2 directory from the libraries folder. This must be done before
 *    this sketch will compile. (Note: the original FlexCAN library will work too).
 * 2. Add the ability to keep track of the number of received messages and display it.
 * 3. Toggle the LEDs each time a message arrives. 
 * 4. Change the output to be in decimal (instead of Hex)
 * 5. Make the data tab separated.
